      "Amazing experience. Itâ€™s been 8 months here. I can see the difference in my muscle strength, core strength, physique & posture. I look well toned now and get lot of compliments. I get personal attention here. That has helped me realise my weak areas, which part of my body is stiff and requires more focus. Strength, flexibility, mobility, endurance and agility everything is being taken care of here. Over all feel very good about my body now. Looking forward to continuing calisthenics till advanced level.",

      "I had approached Punit with the intention of getting fit, healing my knee injury. Itâ€™s been 4 months now since I have joined pure calisthenics. He is knowledgeable and explains you patiently what and why we are doing in such a simple manner that an absolute beginner will easily understand. He has super approachable and answers yours questions. \n \n I have seen improvements in my strength, feel more energetic and lost couple of kilos. Balli and Akshat have been amazing trainers, all the exercises are explained and demonstrated well and they too are really interested in your progression and are open to questions. \n \n Would recommend it 100%!!",

      "Highly recommended Calisthenics training. Very sincere and professional instructor. From nowhere close to headstand, I was able to see my dream coming true of doing headstand independently during my assessment only ( which was free of cost session). Thank you Punit for your genuine and excellent work and keep spreading this knowledge across India. ðŸ¤¸",
